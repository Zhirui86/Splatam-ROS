# About
This Repo contains the code for an indoor implementation of [SplaTAM(CVPR 2024)](https://github.com/spla-tam/SplaTAM).***We substitute the off-line dataset input using real-time ROS input***.
# 🎥Demo

## 🦿Hardware setup
- AgileX Scout Mini Pro
- Intel Realsense D435
## 🖱Software setup
- The code is largely based on SplaTAM(Algorithm),we only add extra code to cope well with ROS input.
- We also try to use some SOTA Monocular Depth Estimation(MDE) methods(e.g. DPT) to make it depth-free.However,the result is not promising.We speculate that this may be due to the robustness of DPT.
- We highly recommend trying other more advanced MDE methods.
